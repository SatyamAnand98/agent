  Implement cache purging for image and video using io river
   1) purge cache


Go through the requirements below and analyze to give me the code that I need to add/ change along with the file. 
NOTE: all the endpoints has to be created in gumlet-api repository
  1. Build API for:
    1.1. Clear all invoices and switch them to free plan -> for any non enterprise plan user
    1.2. unblock account temporarily for x days.
      - API takes x days
      - checks if the organization's unpaid is false in mongodb, mark a new flag which stores the timestamp at which the account can be blocked (after x days)
      - since organization's unpaid is synced with stripe, stripe can update unpaid as true only after the timestamp and reset the timestamp
  2. See if we can handle trial ending case -> mark the user on trial will end, next day switch to free plan via new cron. Reset this flag if trial got extended.
    - When the trial is about to end, we get notification few days before.
    - mark a flag that will mention that the trial is about to end.
    - next day, run a cron that will switch the user to free plan and reset the trial flag
